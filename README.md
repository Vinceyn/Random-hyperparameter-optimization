# Optimization for Machine Learning mini-project: Random search comparisons for hyperparameter optimization

Research mini-project for the CS-439 Optimization for Machine Learning Course.

Designed, Benchmarked and assessed random search algorithms for hyperparameters optimization.


## Research

We decided to focus our research in hyperparameter optimization. We benchmarked different models - classical ones like manual fine-tuning and grid search, but also more uncommon ones like random search. We also benchmarked our own extended random search in this mini-project.

## Dataset and model

We decided to use a public [Heart Attack Dataset]{https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset}

## Report

You can find our report which summarize our work, research and result in the report.pdf file

## Code

You can find our code in the Opti_for_ML.ipynb file
